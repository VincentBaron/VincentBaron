# Welcome to my Github !

## Who am I ?

I am a 42 Paris Student studying Software Development and I am looking to start my Internship this summer. I have a background in Aerospace Engineering and worked as a Field Service Engineer during 2 years. I am now changing orientation with my main interests in Web Developement and Cyber Security.

## What is 42 ?

42 is a peer-to-peer learning Software Developement School which gives us many different projects covering all domains of Software Developement. This school is great in the sense that it teaches you to figure out things out by yourself and spend time understanding the theory behind each project to build the most effective solution. Make sure to look at each projects I have already done to understand the skills I gained and what I achieved, they all have a detailed README explaining what was developped :smile:.
